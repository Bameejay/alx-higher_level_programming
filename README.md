# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs created for ALX Africa's higher-level programming curriculum. I'm now learning Python for these projects, which started in month four of the year one curriculum. Continuously, I continued to practice and improve my C and shell scripting abilities. The following is a list of specific projects:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02-python-import_modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
